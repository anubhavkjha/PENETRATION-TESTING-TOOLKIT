# DESCRIPTION
A TOOLKIT WITH MULTIPLE MODULES (E.G., PORT SCANNER, BRUTE-FORCER) FOR PENETRATION TESTING.
The Penetration Testing Toolkit is a Python-based modular security testing tool designed for ethical hacking and cybersecurity professionals. It includes multiple modules such as a port scanner and a brute-force attack tool to help identify vulnerabilities in network security and authentication mechanisms.
# TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:
Python Built-in Libraries

Library       	Purpose
socket -	    Network communication (port scanning, banner grabbing)

argparse -	  Command-line interface for toolkit

ftplib -	    FTP connection for brute-force attack

os -	        (Optional) File path, system calls, etc.

time -	      (Optional) Add delays, measure response times

# KEY FEATURES:
Port Scanner: Scans specified ports on a target host to identify open services.

Brute Force Login: Attempts to crack web-based authentication using a username and a list of potential passwords.

Password Generator: Creates possible password combinations using custom character sets and lengths.

Modular Structure: Easily extendable with new penetration testing features.

Simple CLI Interface: Easy-to-use command-line interface for quick security assessments.
# USE CASES:
1. Network Security Audits
Identify open ports and exposed services on internal or external hosts.

Detect unnecessary or misconfigured services that may be vulnerable.
 
2. Vulnerability Assessment Prep
Perform basic reconnaissance before using advanced vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS).

Identify weak credentials using brute-force attacks on services like FTP.

3. Ethical Hacking Training
Teach students or professionals the basics of ethical hacking and penetration testing.

Demonstrate real-world concepts like banner grabbing, brute-forcing, and ARP scanning.

4. Red Team Reconnaissance
Gather low-level intel on targets before launching an attack simulation.

Discover live hosts and open services in a target network.

5. Blue Team Defense Testing
Allow defenders to simulate common attacks and verify if their detection systems (IDS/IPS) are triggering alerts.
