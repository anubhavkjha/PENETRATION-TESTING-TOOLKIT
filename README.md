# DESCRIPTION
A TOOLKIT WITH MULTIPLE MODULES (E.G., PORT SCANNER, BRUTE-FORCER) FOR PENETRATION TESTING.
The Penetration Testing Toolkit is a Python-based modular security testing tool designed for ethical hacking and cybersecurity professionals. It includes multiple modules such as a port scanner and a brute-force attack tool to help identify vulnerabilities in network security and authentication mechanisms.
# TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:
1. Python Built-in Libraries
Library     	Purpose
socket -	    Network communication (port scanning, banner grabbing)

argparse -	  Command-line interface for toolkit

ftplib -	    FTP connection for brute-force attack

os -	        (Optional) File path, system calls, etc.

time -	      (Optional) Add delays, measure response times

2. Third-Party Python Libraries
Library	      Purpose	                                                            Install with
scapy    -  	Network packet crafting and sniffing (used in network scanning)	 -  pip install scapy

# KEY FEATURES:
Port Scanner: Scans specified ports on a target host to identify open services.

Brute Force Login: Attempts to crack web-based authentication using a username and a list of potential passwords.

Password Generator: Creates possible password combinations using custom character sets and lengths.

Modular Structure: Easily extendable with new penetration testing features.

Simple CLI Interface: Easy-to-use command-line interface for quick security assessments.
